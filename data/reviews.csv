Central Park,"If you're looking for a scenic spot to pee this is it. Near the water and in central park, what more could you ask for."
Water Closet Reviewer ,
Clements House,"Cool vibes, mostly clean"
Mr. Fongs,"This bathroom is iconic. Running water, paper towels, and a door that locks. If you haven't gone to the bathroom here you're literally no one"
Sunday in Brooklyn,"This bathroom is the shire. Look at that stone sink! Wood, glass, pebbles, rustic!"
El Jefe's Taqueria,Code is 4747
Irving Plaza,Very nice modern style bathrooms... however there is enough piss on the toilet seats that it would take an entire  roll of paper towels to dry
Sauced in Brooklyn,Spookiest peep of your life
Washington Square Park,Rather messy. The people are loud and try to talk to you. Just use a different john or wait until you get home. Not worth the trouble.
The Promenade at a Private Estate,Come here on a lazy afternoon in early summer and pee off the hill overlooking the Hudson. Let the gentle breeze blow through your hair as you take in the view and enter serenity.
Blue ,There is no lock on the door to the restroom and inside there is half a stall with no door on it. The urinal is incredibly tall. In addition to all of this it is one of the grossest bathrooms in the East Village.

The SoNo Collection,"Big stalls, quiet, and clean. What more could you want?"
Grand central,"kinda busy and a little dirty, but good if you're in a hurry to catch a train"
The Ainsworth,Unisex bathroom stalls. Rather clean and nice vibes. Tip jar with candy next to in if you are into that.
Taco Bell Cantina,Restroom out of order. 0/5 literally unusable. Do not come here anytime of day.
Bodega Taco Bar,"Kind of loud, be prepared for a line"
